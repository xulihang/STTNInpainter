# STTNInpainter

Image Inpainter using STTN

The code is modified from [video-subtitle-remover](https://github.com/YaoFANGUK/video-subtitle-remover/) to use it in [ImageTrans](https://www.basiccat.org/imagetrans/).

## How to Run

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Download the model to `backend/models/sttn/infer_model.pth`: [infer_model.pth](https://github.com/YaoFANGUK/video-subtitle-remover/blob/main/backend/models/sttn/infer_model.pth)
* Start the server: `python server.py`

For convenience, you can also use the Windows package: https://github.com/xulihang/STTNInpainter/releases/download/package/STTNInpaint.zip
